## Documentation build process

1. [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/Documenter.jl)
is used to pull doc strings (including those generated by metaprogramming)
from Julia source code and splice them into Markdown documents.

2. [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is used to build a website based on the
Markdown files.

## Usage

Starting from the home directory at the shell:

```
cd .julia/v0.4/PainterQB/docs
julia make.jl
```

To process with mkdocs:
```
mkdocs build --clean
```

To serve locally:
```
mkdocs serve
```

To publish to GitHub:
```
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
```
