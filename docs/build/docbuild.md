## Documentation build process


1. [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/Documenter.jl)


is used to pull doc strings (including those generated by metaprogramming) from Julia source code and splice them into Markdown documents.


2. [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is used to build a website based on the


Markdown files. You can install it with `pip`. You'll also want to install `mkdocs-material` theme.
