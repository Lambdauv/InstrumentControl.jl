Often there are many copies of a measurement routine that differ only slightly, perhaps in the functionality of what happens inside some for loop, etc.\n\n\nWe would like to have clear, reusable code to avoid redundancy and accidental errors, both of which consume precious time on the part of the experimenters. Consider an archetypal measurement scheme wherein we measure a device's response to various stimuli (perhaps we measure current as a function of applied bias). We should be able to write just one sweep function to do this.\n\n\nThe idea of \nmultiple dispatch\n, natively supported in Julia, permits writing such convenient and abstract code. This is just one example where the advantages of multiple dispatch are obvious. We hope it will more broadly simplify the extension of measurement code while ensuring continued reliability.\n\n\n\n\nHow do we take measurements?\n\n\n\n\nSource and measure\n\n\nTwo functions are provided to abstract away many kinds of measurements: \nsource\n and \nmeasure\n. In an experiment you source some stimulus and measure a response. Therefore \nsource\n takes as an argument an object matching type signature \nStimulus\n, which can have different fields for different types of stimuli, as well as some value. \nmeasure\n takes as an argument an object matching type signature \nResponse\n. The idea is to write new subtypes of \nStimulus\n and \nResponse\n to describe what you are doing, as well as new methods for \nsource\n and \nmeasure\n.\n\n\n\n\nStimuli\n\n\nAll stimuli are objects, subtyped from the abstract \nStimulus\n type. Many stimuli, associated with the capabilities of particular instruments, are already implemented.\n\n\nNot all stimuli are associated with a physical instrument. For instance, sourcing a \nDelayStimulus\n will cause the script to block until a specified time after creation of the \nDelayStimulus\n object.\n\n\nStimuli could also be associated with several instruments. Maybe a stimulus that makes sense for a particular experiment would be to change all gate voltages at once. These gate voltages could of course be sourced by several physical instruments.\n\n\n\n\nResponses\n\n\nAll responses are objects, subtyped from the abstract \nResponse\n type. Usually a response is associated with a particular instrument.\n\n\nHowever, responses need not come from instruments. For test purposes, suppose we want to mimic a measurement by generating random numbers. \nRandomResponse\n produces a random number in the unit interval when it is measured. A \nTimerResponse\n will measure the time since creation of the \nTimerResponse\n object.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an instrument?\n\n\nFor the purposes of this package, an instrument is just something connected to the computer that we need to communicate with, and which can source or measure something. Every instrument may connect to the computer by different hardware, comms protocols, and command dialects.\n\n\nAll instruments are Julia objects, subtypes of the abstract type \nInstrument\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstrument types\n\n\nMany instruments share the same communications protocols. We subtype \nInstrument\n based on these protocols.\n\n\n\n\nVISA\n\n\nMany instruments are able to be addressed using the \nVISA\n standard (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture), currently maintained by the IVI Foundation. \nInstrumentVISA\n is an abstract subtype of \nInstrument\n.\n\n\nTo talk to VISA instruments will require the Julia package \nVISA.jl\n as well as the \nNational Instruments VISA libraries\n. Installation instructions are available at each link.\n\n\n\n\nAlazar digitizers\n\n\nDigitizers made by \nAlazarTech\n are notably \nnot\n compatible with the VISA standard. All Alazar digitizers are addressable by an API supplied by the company, which talks to the card through a shared library (a .dll on Windows or .so on Linux). \nInstrumentAlazar\n is an abstract subtype of \nInstrument\n.\n\n\nThe shared library files and API documentation are only available from AlazarTech.\n\n\n\n\nHow do we configure instruments?\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nInstrument properties are configured and inspected using two functions, \nsetindex!\n and \ngetindex\n. This results in a convenient and concise syntax (\ncredit due to Oliver Schulz\n for this idea).\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nawg\n[\nTriggerSlope\n]\n \n=\n \n:\nRising\n\n\nawg\n[\nSampleRate\n]\n \n=\n \n10e6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between stimuli and instrument properties\n\n\nBecause a stimulus is defined so broadly, the difference between a stimulus and an instrument property is not obvious. A stimulus is like a generalized instrument property: sourcing a stimulus may entail configuring zero or more instrument properties.\n\n\nIt is useful to think of a stimulus to be something that what you are measuring has a chance to react to. For example, this could be applied voltage, sourced by one or more instruments. The applied voltages would be seen by the device under test, which would respond accordingly. The stimulus could also just be a time delay, provided by the measurement computer. It could even be the number of threads used by Julia for real-time processing.\n\n\nAn instrument property is any persistent setting of an instrument. Tweaking an instrument property could affect the device under test, but it might not. Averaging is a good example. With averaging a measurement may look less noisy, but your device under test doesn't know the difference. The trigger engine of a digitizer would also have associated instrument properties.\n\n\nIn many cases there is an overlap between stimuli and properties. Consider that the frequency of a signal generator is an instrument property. In this case sourcing a frequency stimulus results in configuring an instrument property. Rather than make a \nFrequencyStimulus\n type, we provide a \nPropertyStimulus\n type which can be used more generically. Consider the following example, where we make a \nPropertyStimulus\n for sweeping the frequency of our E8257D signal generator:\n\n\nstim\n \n=\n \nPropertyStimulus\n(\nsiggen\n::\nE8257D\n,\n \nFrequency\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nfreq\n \nin\n \n1e9\n:\n1e8\n:\n5e9\n     \n# 1 GHz to 5 GHz in steps of 100 MHz\n\n    \nsource\n(\nstim\n,\n \nfreq\n)\n\n    \n# measure(something)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nFrequency\n is a subtype of \nInstrumentProperty\n, which is required for making a \nPropertyStimulus\n.\n\n\nAgain, stimuli need not be tied to a particular property. Rather, this is just one convenient and easily generalized example. In more complicated instances it is probably better to make a new \nStimulus\n subtype rather than use \nPropertyStimulus\n.\n\n\n\n\nFuture directions\n\n\n\n\nFeedback loops\n\n\nIn principle, asynchronous software feedback loops could be implemented with the \nReactive.jl\n package. This would probably only be suitable for slowly varying signals, e.g. PID temperature control. Ultimately benchmarking needs to be done to determine how useful this approach would be.",

By convention, instrument model numbers are used for module definitions (e.g. \nAWG5014C\n), so type names have \"Ins\" prepended (e.g. \nInsAWG5014\n).\n\n\n\n\nInstrumentVISA\n and associated functions are defined in \nsrc/VISA.jl\n.\n\n\nLow-level wrappers for shared libraries are kept in their own packages\n\n\n\n\n(e.g. \nVISA\n and \nAlazar\n calls). This way, at least some code can be reused if someone else does not want to use our codebase.\n\n\n\n\nEarly instrument definitions and functions like \nInstrument\n and\n\n\n\n\nInstrumentException\n are defined in \nsrc/Definitions.jl\n. If there is ever trouble with \nInstrumentProperty\n subtypes not being defined by the time they are used in a function, they can be defined and exported manually here.\n\n\n\n\nexport\n statements from an instrument submodule are not currently exported\n\n\n\n\nfrom \nInstrumentControl\n. Therefore you may want to type \nusing InstrumentControl.AWG5014C\n when using the AWG, for instance.\n\n\n\n\nMetaprogramming for VISA instruments\n\n\nMany commercial instruments support a common communications protocol and command syntax (VISA and SCPI respectively). For such instruments, methods for \nsetindex!\n and \ngetindex\n can be generated with metaprogramming, rather than typing them out explicitly.\n\n\nThe file \nsrc/Metaprogramming.jl\n is used heavily for code generation based on JSON template files. Since much of the logic for talking to instruments is the same between VISA instruments, in some cases no code needs to be written to control a new instrument provided an appropriate template file is prepared.

The property dictionary is built out of an auxiliary JSON file described above.\n\n\nThis function is responsible for generating the \nInstrumentProperty\n subtypes to use with \ngetindex\n and \nsetindex!\n if they have not been defined already. Ordinarily these types are defined in the InstrumentControl module but if a really generic name is desired that makes sense for a class of instruments (e.g. \nVNA.Format\n) then the \nFormat\n subtype is defined in the \nInstrumentControl.VNA\n module. The defined subtype is then imported into the module where the \ninstype\n is defined.\n\n\nIf you an encounter an error where it appears like the subtypes were not defined, it may be that they are being referenced from a module that did an \nimport\n statement too soon, before all relevant \nInstrumentProperty\n subtypes were defined and exported.

InstrumentVISA  and associated functions are defined in  src/VISA.jl .  Low-level wrappers for shared libraries are kept in their own packages   (e.g.  VISA  and  Alazar  calls).

Early instrument definitions and functions like  Instrument  and   InstrumentException  are defined in  src/Definitions.jl . If there is ever trouble with  InstrumentProperty  subtypes not being defined by the time they are used in a function, they can be defined and exported manually here.   export  statements from an instrument submodule are not currently exported   from  InstrumentControl .

            "text": "Many commercial instruments support a common communications protocol and command syntax (VISA and SCPI respectively). For such instruments, methods for  setindex!  and  getindex  can be generated with metaprogramming, rather than typing them out explicitly.  The file  src/Metaprogramming.jl  is used heavily for code generation based on JSON template files. Since much of the logic for talking to instruments is the same between VISA instruments, in some cases no code needs to be written to control a new instrument provided an appropriate template file is prepared. The metaprogramming functions are described below although they are not intended to be used interactively.  #  InstrumentControl.insjson     Function .  insjson{T :Instrument}(::Type{T})  Simple wrapper to call  insjson  on the appropriate file path for a given instrument type.  source  insjson(file::AbstractString)  Parses a JSON file with a standardized schema to describe how to control an instrument.  Here is an example of a valid JSON file with valid schema for parsing:  { \n     instrument :{ \n             module : E5071C , \n             type : InsE5071C , \n             make : Keysight , \n             model : E5071C , \n             writeterminator : \\n \n     }, \n     properties :[ \n         { \n             cmd : :CALCch:TRACtr:CORR:EDEL:TIME , \n             type : VNA.ElectricalDelay , \n             values :[ \n                 v::Real \n             ], \n             infixes :[ \n                 ch::Integer=1 , \n                 tr::Integer=1 \n             ], \n             doc :   My documentation \n         } \n     ]  }   After loading with  JSON.parse , all dictionary keys are converted to symbols. The  instrument  dictionary is described in the  generate_instruments  documentation. The  properties  array contains one or more dictionaries, each with keys:   cmd : Specifies what must be sent to the instrument (it should be   terminated with \"?\" for query-only). The lower-case characters are replaced by infix arguments.   type : Specifies the  InstrumentProperty  subtype to use this command. Will be   parsed and evaluated.   values : Specifies the required arguments for  setindex!  which will   appear after  cmd  in the string sent to the instrument.   infixes : Specifies the infix arguments in  cmd . Symbol names must match   infix arguments. This key is not required if there are no infixes.   doc : Specifies documentation for the generated Julia functions. This key   is not required if there is no documentation. This is used not only for interactive help but also in generating the documentation you are reading.  The value of the  properties.type  field and entries in the  properties.values  and  properties.infixes  arrays are parsed by Julia into expressions or symbols for further manipulation.  source  #  InstrumentControl.generate_all     Function .  generate_all(metadata)  This function takes a dictionary of instrument metadata, typically obtained from a call to  insjson . It will go through the following steps:   generate_instruments  part 1: If the module for this instrument does not   already exist, generate it and import required modules and symbols.   generate_instruments  part 2: Define the  Instrument  subtype and the  make   and  model  methods ( make  and  model  are defined in  src/Definitions.jl ). Export the subtype.   generate_properties : Generate instrument properties if they do   not exist already, and do any necessary importing and exporting.   generate_handlers : Generate \"handler\" methods to convert between   symbols and SCPI string args.   generate_inspect : Generate  getindex  methods for instrument properties.  generate_configure : Generate  setindex!  methods for instrument properties.   generate_all  should be called near the start of an instrument's .jl file, if one exists. It is not required to have a source file for each instrument if the automatically generated code is sufficient.  source  #  InstrumentControl.generate_instruments     Function .  generate_instruments(metadata)  This function takes a dictionary of metadata, typically obtained from a call to  insjson . It operates on the  :instrument  field of the dictionary which is expected to have the following structure:   module : The module name. Can already exist but is created if it does not.   This field is converted from a string to a  Symbol  by  insjson .   type : The name of the type to create for the new instrument.   This field is converted from a string to a  Symbol  by  insjson .   super : This field is optional. If provided it will be the supertype of   the new instrument type, otherwise the supertype will be  Instrument . This field is converted from a string to a  Symbol  by  insjson .   make : The make of the instrument, e.g. Keysight, Tektronix, etc.  model : The model of the instrument, e.g. E5071C, AWG5014C, etc.  writeterminator : Write termination string for sending SCPI commands.   By convention we typically have the module name be the same as the model name, and the type is just the model prefixed by \"Ins\", e.g.  InsE5071C . This is not required.  source  #  InstrumentControl.generate_properties     Function .  generate_properties{S :Instrument}(instype::Type{S}, p)  This function takes an  Instrument  subtype  instype , and a property dictionary  p . The property dictionary is built out of an auxiliary JSON file described above.  This function is responsible for generating the  InstrumentProperty  subtypes to use with  getindex  and  setindex!  if they have not been defined already. Ordinarily these types are defined in the InstrumentControl module but if a really generic name is desired that makes sense for a class of instruments (e.g.  VNA.Format ) then the  Format  subtype is defined in the  InstrumentControl.VNA  module. The defined subtype is then imported into the module where the  instype  is defined.  If you an encounter an error where it appears like the subtypes were not defined, it may be that they are being referenced from a module that did an  import  statement too soon, before all relevant  InstrumentProperty  subtypes were defined and exported. Ordinarily this is not a problem.  source  #  InstrumentControl.generate_handlers     Function .  generate_handlers{S :Instrument}(instype::Type{S}, p)  This function takes an  Instrument  subtype  instype , and a property dictionary  p . The property dictionary is built out of an auxiliary JSON file described above.  In some cases, an instrument command does not except numerical arguments but rather a small set of options. Here is an example of the property dictionary (prior to parsing) for such a command, which sets/gets the format for a given channel and trace on the E5071C vector network analyzer:  { \n     cmd : :CALCch:TRACtr:FORM , \n     type : VNA.Format , \n     values :[ \n         v::Symbol in symbols \n     ], \n     symbols :{ \n         LogMagnitude : MLOG , \n         Phase : PHAS , \n         GroupDelay : GDEL , \n         SmithLinear : SLIN , \n         SmithLog : SLOG , \n         SmithComplex : SCOM , \n         Smith : SMIT , \n         SmithAdmittance : SADM , \n         PolarLinear : PLIN , \n         PolarLog : PLOG , \n         PolarComplex : POL , \n         LinearMagnitude : MLIN , \n         SWR : SWR , \n         RealPart : REAL , \n         ImagPart : IMAG , \n         ExpandedPhase : UPH , \n         PositivePhase : PPH \n     }, \n     infixes :[ \n         ch::Integer=1 , \n         tr::Integer=1 \n     ], \n     doc : Hey  }   We see here that the  values  key is saying that we are only going to accept  Symbol  type for our  setindex!  method and the symbol has to come out of  symbols , a dictionary that is defined on the next line. The keys of this dictionary are going to be interpreted as symbols (e.g.  :LogMagnitude ) and the values are just ASCII strings to be sent to the instrument.  generate_handlers  makes a bidirectional mapping between the symbols and the strings. In this example, this is accomplished as follows:  symbols ( ins :: E5071C ,   :: Type { VNA . Format },   v :: Symbol )   =   symbols ( ins ,   VNA . Format ,   Val { v })  symbols ( ins :: E5071C ,   :: Type { VNA . Format },   :: Type { Val {: LogMagnitude }})   =   MLOG   # ... etc. for each symbol.  VNA . Format ( ins :: E5071C ,   s :: AbstractString )   =   VNA . Format ( ins ,   Val { symbol ( s )})  VNA . Format ( ins :: E5071C ,   :: Type { Val { Symbol ( MLOG )}})   =   : LogMagnitude   # ... etc. for each symbol.   The above methods will be defined in the E5071C module. Note that the function  symbols  has its name chosen based on the dictionary name in the JSON file. Since this function is not exported from the instrument's module there should be few namespace worries and we maintain future flexibliity.  source  #  InstrumentControl.generate_configure     Function .  generate_configure{S :Instrument}(instype::Type{S}, p)  This function takes an  Instrument  subtype  instype , and a property dictionary  p .

Traditional record mode has not been implemented yet for lack of immediate need.\n\n\nLooking at the source code, it would seem that there is some redundancy in the types, for instance there is an \nNPTRecordMode\n and an \nNPTRecordResponse\n object. The difference is that the former is used internally in the code to denote a particular method of configuring the instrument, allocating buffers, etc., whereas the latter specifies what you actually want to do: retrieve NPT records from the digitizer, perhaps doing some post-processing or processing during acquisition along the way. Perhaps different responses would dictate different processing behavior, while the instrument is ultimately configured the same way.\n\n\nIn the following discussion, it is important to understand some Alazar terminology. Newer Alazar digitizers use direct memory access (DMA) to stream data into a computer's RAM. A single \nacquisition\n uses one or many \nbuffers\n, which constitute preallocated regions in the computer's physical memory. Each buffer contains one or many \nrecords\n. Each \nrecord\n contains many \nsamples\n, which are the voltages measured by the digitizer.\n\n\nIn streaming mode, there is only one record per buffer, but in other modes there can be many records per buffer.\n\n\n\n\nBuffer allocation\n\n\n\n\nDigitizer requirements\n\n\nThe Alazar digitizers expect buffers in physical memory which are page-aligned. The size of each buffer should also be chosen appropriately.\n\n\nThe behavior of the digitizer is not specified when the buffer is made larger than 64 MB. On our computer, it seems like an \nApiWaitTimeout\n error is thrown when the buffer is too large (for some unspecified definition of \"large\" greater than 64 MB). The digitizer will then throw \nApiInsufficientResources\n errors whenever another acquisition is attempted, until the computer is restarted. Just restarting the Julia kernel, forcing a reload of the Alazar DLLs, does not appear to be enough to reset the digitizer fully.\n\n\nFor performance reasons, a buffer should not be made much smaller than 1 MB if mulitple buffers are required. There is also a minimum record size for each model of digitizer. For the ATS9360, if a record has fewer than 256 samples (could be 128 from channel A + 128 from channel B) then the acquisition will proceed, but return garbage data. Allocating too small of a buffer is therefore still bad, but less fatal than allocating one that is too large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to allocate appropriate buffers in Julia\n\n\nIn Julia, just allocating a fixed-size array will not necessarily return a page-aligned block in memory. One approach would be to allocate our own page-aligned memory using \nvalloc\n and \nvfree\n (or their Windows equivalents).\n\n\nfunction virtualalloc{T\n:Union{UInt8,UInt16}}(size_bytes::Integer, ::Type{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_COMMIT = U32(0x1000)\n        PAGE_READWRITE = U32(0x4)\n        addr = ccall((:VirtualAlloc, \nKernel32\n), Ptr{T},\n                     (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong, Culong),\n                     C_NULL, size_bytes, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        addr = ccall((:valloc, libc), Ptr{T}, (Culonglong,), size_bytes)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n\n    addr == C_NULL \n throw(OutOfMemoryError())\n\n    addr::Ptr{T}\nend\n\nfunction virtualfree{T\n:Union{UInt16,UInt8}}(addr::Ptr{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_RELEASE = 0x8000\n        ccall((:VirtualFree, \nKernel32\n), Cint, (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong),\n            addr, Culonglong(0), MEM_RELEASE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        ccall((:free, \nlibc\n), Void, (Ptr{Void},), addr)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n    nothing\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious, this was my original approach. Note that memory allocated in this way will not be visible to multiple processes without extra work, and moreover we will need to deallocate the memory ourselves at a later time, perhaps using \nfinalizer()\n if the memory is made to be part of a Julia object.\n\n\nFortunately, there is a special kind of array in Julia called the \nSharedArray\n. It can be viewed and modified from multiple processes, and the memory is page-aligned. Hopefully this continues to be the case in future Julia releases. We implement a type called the \nDMABufferArray\n whose definition is worth repeating here:\n\n\ntype DMABufferArray{sample_type} \n:\n        AbstractArray{Ptr{sample_type},1}\n\n    bytes_buf::Int\n    n_buf::Int\n    backing::SharedArray{sample_type}\n\n    DMABufferArray(bytes_buf, n_buf) = begin\n        n_buf \n 1 \n bytes_buf % Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE != 0 \n\n            error(\nBytes per buffer must be a multiple of Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE when \n,\n                  \nthere is more than one buffer.\n)\n\n        backing = SharedArray(sample_type,\n                        Int((bytes_buf * n_buf) / sizeof(sample_type)))\n\n        dmabuf = new(bytes_buf,\n                     n_buf,\n                     backing)\n\n        return dmabuf\n    end\n\nend\n\nBase.size(dma::DMABufferArray) = (dma.n_buf,)\nBase.linearindexing(::Type{DMABufferArray}) = Base.LinearFast()\nBase.getindex(dma::DMABufferArray, i::Int) =\n    pointer(dma.backing) + (i-1) * dma.bytes_buf\nBase.length(dma::DMABufferArray) = dma.n_buf\n\nbytespersample{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = sizeof(T)\nsampletype{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = T\n\n\n\n\n\nSome comments:\n\n\n\n\nA single SharedArray is used to back \nall\n DMA buffers.
