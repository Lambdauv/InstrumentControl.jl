Often there are many copies of a measurement routine that differ only slightly, perhaps in the functionality of what happens inside some for loop, etc.\n\n\nWe would like to have clear, reusable code to avoid redundancy and accidental errors, both of which consume precious time on the part of the experimenters. Consider an archetypal measurement scheme wherein we measure a device's response to various stimuli (perhaps we measure current as a function of applied bias). We should be able to write just one sweep function to do this:\n\n\nfunction\n sweep\n(\nch0\n::\nStimulus\n,\n \nch1\n::\nResponse\n,\n \nx_itr\n,\n \ntstep\n)\n\n    \nmap\n(\nx_itr\n)\n \ndo\n \nx\n\n        \nsource\n(\nch0\n,\n \nx\n)\n\n        \nsleep\n(\ntstep\n)\n\n        \nmeasure\n(\nch1\n)\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of \nmultiple dispatch\n, natively supported in Julia, permits writing such convenient and abstract code. This is just one example where the advantages of multiple dispatch are obvious. We hope it will more broadly simplify the extension of measurement code while ensuring continued reliability.\n\n\n\n\nHow do we take measurements?\n\n\n\n\nSource and measure\n\n\nTwo functions are provided to abstract away many kinds of measurements: \nsource\n and \nmeasure\n. In an experiment you source some stimulus and measure a response. Therefore \nsource\n takes as an argument an object matching type signature \nStimulus\n, which can have different fields for different types of stimuli, as well as some value. \nmeasure\n takes as an argument an object matching type signature \nResponse\n. The idea is to write new subtypes of \nStimulus\n and \nResponse\n to describe what you are doing, as well as new methods for \nsource\n and \nmeasure\n.\n\n\n\n\nStimuli\n\n\nAll stimuli are objects, subtyped from the abstract \nStimulus\n type. Many stimuli, associated with the capabilities of particular instruments, are already implemented.\n\n\nNot all stimuli are associated with a physical instrument. For instance, sourcing a \nDelayStimulus\n will cause the script to block until a specified time after creation of the \nDelayStimulus\n object.\n\n\nStimuli could also be associated with several instruments. Maybe a stimulus that makes sense for a particular experiment would be to change all gate voltages at once. These gate voltages could of course be sourced by several physical instruments.\n\n\n\n\nResponses\n\n\nAll responses are objects, subtyped from the abstract parametric \nResponse{T}\n type. We use a parametric type for responses so that the return type of the numerical data is clear. Usually a response is associated with a particular instrument.\n\n\nHowever, responses need not come from instruments. For test purposes, suppose we want to mimic a measurement by generating random numbers. \nRandomResponse\n produces a random number in the unit interval when it is measured. A \nTimerResponse\n will measure the time since creation of the \nTimerResponse\n object.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an instrument?\n\n\nFor the purposes of this package, an instrument is just something connected to the computer that we need to communicate with, and which can source or measure something. Every instrument may connect to the computer by different hardware, comms protocols, and command dialects.\n\n\nAll instruments are Julia objects, subtypes of the abstract type \nInstrument\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstrument types\n\n\nMany instruments share the same communications protocols. We subtype \nInstrument\n based on these protocols.\n\n\n\n\nVISA\n\n\nMany instruments are able to be addressed using the \nVISA\n standard (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture), currently maintained by the IVI Foundation. \nInstrumentVISA\n is an abstract subtype of \nInstrument\n.\n\n\nTo talk to VISA instruments will require the Julia package \nVISA.jl\n as well as the \nNational Instruments VISA libraries\n. Installation instructions are available at each link.\n\n\n\n\nAlazar digitizers\n\n\nDigitizers made by \nAlazarTech\n are notably \nnot\n compatible with the VISA standard. All Alazar digitizers are addressable by an API supplied by the company, which talks to the card through a shared library (a .dll on Windows or .so on Linux). \nInstrumentAlazar\n is an abstract subtype of \nInstrument\n.\n\n\nThe shared library files and API documentation are only available from AlazarTech.\n\n\n\n\nHow do we configure instruments?\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nInstrument properties are configured and inspected using two functions, \nsetindex!\n and \ngetindex\n. This results in a convenient and concise syntax (\ncredit due to Oliver Schulz\n for this idea).\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nawg\n[\nTriggerSlope\n]\n \n=\n \n:\nRising\n\n\nawg\n[\nSampleRate\n]\n \n=\n \n10e6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between stimuli and instrument properties\n\n\nBecause a stimulus is defined so broadly, the difference between a stimulus and an instrument property is not obvious. A stimulus is like a generalized instrument property: sourcing a stimulus may entail configuring zero or more instrument properties.\n\n\nIt is useful to think of a stimulus to be something that what you are measuring has a chance to react to. For example, this could be applied voltage, sourced by one or more instruments. The applied voltages would be seen by the device under test, which would respond accordingly. The stimulus could also just be a time delay, provided by the measurement computer. It could even be the number of threads used by Julia for real-time processing.\n\n\nAn instrument property is any persistent setting of an instrument. Tweaking an instrument property could affect the device under test, but it might not. Averaging is a good example. With averaging a measurement may look less noisy, but your device under test doesn't know the difference. The trigger engine of a digitizer would also have associated instrument properties.\n\n\nIn many cases there is an overlap between stimuli and properties. Consider that the frequency of a signal generator is an instrument property. In this case sourcing a frequency stimulus results in configuring an instrument property. Rather than make a \nFrequencyStimulus\n type, we provide a \nPropertyStimulus\n type which can be used more generically. Consider the following example, where we make a \nPropertyStimulus\n for sweeping the frequency of our E8257D signal generator:\n\n\nstim\n \n=\n \nPropertyStimulus\n(\nsiggen\n::\nE8257D\n,\n \nFrequency\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nfreq\n \nin\n \n1e9\n:\n1e8\n:\n5e9\n     \n# 1 GHz to 5 GHz in steps of 100 MHz\n\n    \nsource\n(\nstim\n,\n \nfreq\n)\n\n    \n# measure(something)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nFrequency\n is a subtype of \nInstrumentProperty\n, which is required for making a \nPropertyStimulus\n.\n\n\nAgain, stimuli need not be tied to a particular property. Rather, this is just one convenient and easily generalized example. In more complicated instances it is probably better to make a new \nStimulus\n subtype rather than use \nPropertyStimulus\n.\n\n\n\n\nFuture directions\n\n\n\n\nFeedback loops\n\n\nIn principle, asynchronous software feedback loops could be implemented with the \nReactive.jl\n package. This would probably only be suitable for slowly varying signals, e.g. PID temperature control. Ultimately benchmarking needs to be done to determine how useful this approach would be.",

            "text": "Implementation overview\n\n\n\n\nCode organization\n\n\nOrganizing the code into Julia modules is tricky and the organization may change in future releases. It would not be surprising if the way Julia implements modules changes before Julia v1.0.\n\n\n\n\nWith few exceptions, all code is kept inside a single package. For now the package is unregistered and must be retrieved from the repository with \nPkg.clone()\n rather than \nPkg.add()\n.     - Low-level wrappers for shared libraries are kept in their own packages     (e.g. VISA and Alazar calls). This way, at least some code can be reused if     someone else does not want to use our codebase.\n\n\nAll code is kept inside a \"main\" \nPainterQB\n module, defined inside \nsrc/PainterQB.jl\n.     - Common instrument definitions and functions are defined in \nsrc/Definitions.jl\n.     - \nInstrumentVISA\n and associated functions are defined in \nsrc/VISA.jl\n.     - Code that should be loaded by Julia workers for parallel processing is     actually kept outside the module to avoid loading the whole module unnecessarily.     These are typically functions that are focused on number crunching and don't     need to know much about the internals of PainterQB.\n\n\nEach instrument is defined within its own module, a submodule of \nPainterQB\n.     - Each instrument has a corresponding .jl file in \nsrc/instruments\n.     - Instrument model numbers are used for type definitions (e.g. \nAWG5014C\n),     so module names have \"Module\" appended (e.g. \nAWG5014CModule\n). We put all     Alazar digitizers in \nAlazarModule\n; the feature set and API is so similar     for the various models that just one module makes sense.     - \nexport\n statements from an instrument submodule are not currently exported     from \nPainterQB\n. The statement \nusing PainterQB.AWG5014CModule\n     may be desired when using the AWG, for instance.\n\n\nTo test for possible namespace conflicts when adding new instruments, uncomment the \nimportall\n statements in \nsrc/PainterQB.jl\n.     - As functions from different instrument modules are imported, any functions     that are defined in different modules will be printed and warned about. The     solution is to define the shared function name in \nsrc/Definitions.jl\n     (\nglobal\n and \nexport\n) such that the submodules can both import the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISA instruments\n\n\nMany commercial instruments support a common communications protocol and command syntax (VISA and SCPI respectively). For such instruments, many methods for \nsetindex!\n and \ngetindex\n can be generated with metaprogramming, rather than typing them out explicitly.\n\n\nThe file \nsrc/Metaprogramming.jl\n is included in each VISA instrument's source file, and therefore in each instrument's own module. In the future this might be improved through more judicious choice of which module \neval\n is run in.\n\n\n\n\nMetaprogramming\n\n\nThe following methods are internal and do not need to be used explicitly. They are described here for completeness.\n\n\n#\n\n\nPainterQB.insjson\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\n\n\ninsjson(file::AbstractString)\n\n\nParses a JSON file with a standardized schema to describe how to control an instrument.\n\n\nHere is an example of a valid JSON file with valid schema for parsing:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nproperties\n:[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n:CALCch:TRACtr:CORR:EDEL:TIME\n,\n\n            \ntype\n:\nVNA.ElectricalDelay\n,\n\n            \nvalues\n:[\n\n                \nv::Real\n\n            \n],\n\n            \ninfixes\n:[\n\n                \nch::Integer=1\n,\n\n                \ntr::Integer=1\n\n            \n],\n\n            \ndoc\n:\n \nMy documentation\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncmd\n: Specifies what must be sent to the instrument (it should be terminated with \"?\" for query-only).

The property dictionary is built out of an auxiliary JSON file described above.\n\n\nThis function is responsible for generating the \nInstrumentProperty\n subtypes to use with \ngetindex\n and \nsetindex!\n if they have not been defined already. Ordinarily these types are defined in the PainterQB module but if a really generic name is desired that makes sense for a class of instruments (e.g. \nVNA.Format\n) then the \nFormat\n subtype is defined in the \nPainterQB.VNA\n module.

The keys of this dictionary are going to be interpreted as symbols (e.g. \n:LogMagnitude\n) and the values are just ASCII strings to be sent to the instrument.\n\n\ngenerate_handlers\n makes a bidirectional mapping between the symbols and the strings.

Note that the function \nsymbols\n has its name chosen based on the dictionary name in the JSON file. This was done for future flexibliity.\n\n\n#\n\n\nPainterQB.generate_configure\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\n\n\ngenerate_configure{S\n:Instrument}(instype::Type{S}, p)\n\n\nThis function takes an \nInstrument\n subtype \ninstype\n, and a property dictionary \np\n.

The method is defined in the module where the instrument type was defined.\n\n\n\n\nResponses\n\n\nUnlike stimuli, all responses are subtypes of an abstract parametric type, \nResponse{T}\n. Although it may seem unduly abstract to have it be both abstract and parametric, we use this functionality to distinguish between desired return types of a measurement. Suppose an instrument provides data in some kind of awkward format, like 12-bit unsigned integers. For reasons of convenience we may want the measurement to return the data in a machine-native \nInt64\n format, or we may want to specify a linear or 2D shape for the data, etc.\n\n\nAn important consideration in writing fast Julia code is to ensure type stability. In other words, the type that is returned from a function should depend only on the method signature and not depend on some value at run-time. By parameterizing \nResponse\n types with the return type, we can ensure that \nmeasure\n will be type stable. If we instead had the desired return type as some field in a \nResponse\n object, then \nmeasure\n would not be type stable.\n\n\n\n\nAlazar digitizers\n\n\nA response type is given for each measurement mode: continuous streaming (\nContinuousStreamResponse\n), triggered streaming ( \nTriggeredStreamResponse\n), NPT records (\nNPTRecordResponse\n), and FPGA-based FFT calculations (\nFFTHardwareResponse\n). Traditional record mode has not been implemented yet for lack of immediate need.\n\n\nLooking at the source code, it would seem that there is some redundancy in the types, for instance there is an \nNPTRecordMode\n and an \nNPTRecordResponse\n object. The difference is that the former is used internally in the code to denote a particular method of configuring the instrument, allocating buffers, etc., whereas the latter specifies what you actually want to do: retrieve NPT records from the digitizer, perhaps doing some post-processing or processing during acquisition along the way. Perhaps different responses would dictate different processing behavior, while the instrument is ultimately configured the same way.\n\n\n\n\nAlazar instruments\n\n\nIn the following discussion, it is important to understand some Alazar terminology. Newer Alazar digitizers use direct memory access (DMA) to stream data into a computer's RAM. A single \nacquisition\n uses one or many \nbuffers\n, which constitute preallocated regions in the computer's physical memory. Each buffer contains one or many \nrecords\n. Each \nrecord\n contains many \nsamples\n, which are the voltages measured by the digitizer.\n\n\nIn streaming mode, there is only one record per buffer, but in other modes there can be many records per buffer.\n\n\n\n\nBuffer allocation\n\n\n\n\nDigitizer requirements\n\n\nThe Alazar digitizers expect buffers in physical memory which are page-aligned. The size of each buffer should also be chosen appropriately.\n\n\nThe behavior of the digitizer is not specified when the buffer is made larger than 64 MB. On our computer, it seems like an \nApiWaitTimeout\n error is thrown when the buffer is too large (for some unspecified definition of \"large\" greater than 64 MB). The digitizer will then throw \nApiInsufficientResources\n errors whenever another acquisition is attempted, until the computer is restarted. Just restarting the Julia kernel, forcing a reload of the Alazar DLLs, does not appear to be enough to reset the digitizer fully.\n\n\nFor performance reasons, a buffer should not be made much smaller than 1 MB if mulitple buffers are required. There is also a minimum record size for each model of digitizer. For the ATS9360, if a record has fewer than 256 samples (could be 128 from channel A + 128 from channel B) then the acquisition will proceed, but return garbage data. Allocating too small of a buffer is therefore still bad, but less fatal than allocating one that is too large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to allocate appropriate buffers in Julia\n\n\nIn Julia, just allocating a fixed-size array will not necessarily return a page-aligned block in memory. One approach would be to allocate our own page-aligned memory using \nvalloc\n and \nvfree\n (or their Windows equivalents).\n\n\nfunction virtualalloc{T\n:Union{UInt8,UInt16}}(size_bytes::Integer, ::Type{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_COMMIT = U32(0x1000)\n        PAGE_READWRITE = U32(0x4)\n        addr = ccall((:VirtualAlloc, \nKernel32\n), Ptr{T},\n                     (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong, Culong),\n                     C_NULL, size_bytes, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        addr = ccall((:valloc, libc), Ptr{T}, (Culonglong,), size_bytes)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n\n    addr == C_NULL \n throw(OutOfMemoryError())\n\n    addr::Ptr{T}\nend\n\nfunction virtualfree{T\n:Union{UInt16,UInt8}}(addr::Ptr{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_RELEASE = 0x8000\n        ccall((:VirtualFree, \nKernel32\n), Cint, (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong),\n            addr, Culonglong(0), MEM_RELEASE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        ccall((:free, \nlibc\n), Void, (Ptr{Void},), addr)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n    nothing\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious, this was my original approach. Note that memory allocated in this way will not be visible to multiple processes without extra work, and moreover we will need to deallocate the memory ourselves at a later time, perhaps using \nfinalizer()\n if the memory is made to be part of a Julia object.\n\n\nFortunately, there is a special kind of array in Julia called the \nSharedArray\n. It can be viewed and modified from multiple processes, and the memory is page-aligned. Hopefully this continues to be the case in future Julia releases. We implement a type called the \nDMABufferArray\n whose definition is worth repeating here:\n\n\ntype DMABufferArray{sample_type} \n:\n        AbstractArray{Ptr{sample_type},1}\n\n    bytes_buf::Int\n    n_buf::Int\n    backing::SharedArray{sample_type}\n\n    DMABufferArray(bytes_buf, n_buf) = begin\n        n_buf \n 1 \n bytes_buf % Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE != 0 \n\n            error(\nBytes per buffer must be a multiple of Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE when \n,\n                  \nthere is more than one buffer.\n)\n\n        backing = SharedArray(sample_type,\n                        Int((bytes_buf * n_buf) / sizeof(sample_type)))\n\n        dmabuf = new(bytes_buf,\n                     n_buf,\n                     backing)\n\n        return dmabuf\n    end\n\nend\n\nBase.size(dma::DMABufferArray) = (dma.n_buf,)\nBase.linearindexing(::Type{DMABufferArray}) = Base.LinearFast()\nBase.getindex(dma::DMABufferArray, i::Int) =\n    pointer(dma.backing) + (i-1) * dma.bytes_buf\nBase.length(dma::DMABufferArray) = dma.n_buf\n\nbytespersample{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = sizeof(T)\nsampletype{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = T\n\n\n\n\n\nSome comments:\n\n\n\n\nA single SharedArray is used to back \nall\n DMA buffers. Memory is therefore contiguous and page-aligned.\n\n\nThe memory for each DMA buffer is required to be a multiple of the page size when there is more than one buffer.\n\n\nThe memory can be accessed by multiple processes.\n\n\nThe elements of a \nDMABufferArray\n are pointers to the the different locations in memory which act as DMA buffers. The array is iterable and indexable as usual.",

This way, at least some code can be reused if     someone else does not want to use our codebase.  All code is kept inside a \"main\"  PainterQB  module, defined inside  src/PainterQB.jl .     - Common instrument definitions and functions are defined in  src/Definitions.jl .     -  InstrumentVISA  and associated functions are defined in  src/VISA.jl .     - Code that should be loaded by Julia workers for parallel processing is     actually kept outside the module to avoid loading the whole module unnecessarily.     These are typically functions that are focused on number crunching and don't     need to know much about the internals of PainterQB.  Each instrument is defined within its own module, a submodule of  PainterQB .     - Each instrument has a corresponding .jl file in  src/instruments .     - Instrument model numbers are used for type definitions (e.g.  AWG5014C ),     so module names have \"Module\" appended (e.g.  AWG5014CModule ). We put all     Alazar digitizers in  AlazarModule ; the feature set and API is so similar     for the various models that just one module makes sense.     -  export  statements from an instrument submodule are not currently exported     from  PainterQB . The statement  using PainterQB.AWG5014CModule      may be desired when using the AWG, for instance.  To test for possible namespace conflicts when adding new instruments, uncomment the  importall  statements in  src/PainterQB.jl .     - As functions from different instrument modules are imported, any functions     that are defined in different modules will be printed and warned about.

One approach would be to allocate our own page-aligned memory using  valloc  and  vfree  (or their Windows equivalents).  function virtualalloc{T :Union{UInt8,UInt16}}(size_bytes::Integer, ::Type{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_COMMIT = U32(0x1000)\n        PAGE_READWRITE = U32(0x4)\n        addr = ccall((:VirtualAlloc,  Kernel32 ), Ptr{T},\n                     (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong, Culong),\n                     C_NULL, size_bytes, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        addr = ccall((:valloc, libc), Ptr{T}, (Culonglong,), size_bytes)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n\n    addr == C_NULL   throw(OutOfMemoryError())\n\n    addr::Ptr{T}\nend\n\nfunction virtualfree{T :Union{UInt16,UInt8}}(addr::Ptr{T})\n    @windows? begin\n        MEM_RELEASE = 0x8000\n        ccall((:VirtualFree,  Kernel32 ), Cint, (Ptr{Void}, Culonglong, Culong),\n            addr, Culonglong(0), MEM_RELEASE)\n    end : (@linux? begin\n        ccall((:free,  libc ), Void, (Ptr{Void},), addr)\n    end : throw(SystemError()))\n    nothing\nend  In case it wasn't obvious, this was my original approach. Note that memory allocated in this way will not be visible to multiple processes without extra work, and moreover we will need to deallocate the memory ourselves at a later time, perhaps using  finalizer()  if the memory is made to be part of a Julia object.  Fortunately, there is a special kind of array in Julia called the  SharedArray . It can be viewed and modified from multiple processes, and the memory is page-aligned. Hopefully this continues to be the case in future Julia releases. We implement a type called the  DMABufferArray  whose definition is worth repeating here:  type DMABufferArray{sample_type}  :\n        AbstractArray{Ptr{sample_type},1}\n\n    bytes_buf::Int\n    n_buf::Int\n    backing::SharedArray{sample_type}\n\n    DMABufferArray(bytes_buf, n_buf) = begin\n        n_buf   1   bytes_buf % Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE != 0  \n            error( Bytes per buffer must be a multiple of Base.Mmap.PAGESIZE when  ,\n                   there is more than one buffer. )\n\n        backing = SharedArray(sample_type,\n                        Int((bytes_buf * n_buf) / sizeof(sample_type)))\n\n        dmabuf = new(bytes_buf,\n                     n_buf,\n                     backing)\n\n        return dmabuf\n    end\n\nend\n\nBase.size(dma::DMABufferArray) = (dma.n_buf,)\nBase.linearindexing(::Type{DMABufferArray}) = Base.LinearFast()\nBase.getindex(dma::DMABufferArray, i::Int) =\n    pointer(dma.backing) + (i-1) * dma.bytes_buf\nBase.length(dma::DMABufferArray) = dma.n_buf\n\nbytespersample{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = sizeof(T)\nsampletype{T}(buf_array::DMABufferArray{T}) = T  Some comments:   A single SharedArray is used to back  all  DMA buffers. Memory is therefore contiguous and page-aligned.  The memory for each DMA buffer is required to be a multiple of the page size when there is more than one buffer.  The memory can be accessed by multiple processes.  The elements of a  DMABufferArray  are pointers to the the different locations in memory which act as DMA buffers. The array is iterable and indexable as usual.",
