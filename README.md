# Controlling instruments in Julia

[Painter group](http://copilot.caltech.edu) implementation of instrument control in [Julia](https://github.com/julialang/Julia). Special attention is being given to instruments suitable for qubit measurements. Work in progress, not ready for implementation.

[Documentation](https://painterqubits.github.io/InstrumentControl.jl/) is being written as the code is developed.
